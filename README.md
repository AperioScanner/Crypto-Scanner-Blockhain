## 🔍 Under the Hood

Aperio queries the blockchain.com public API to retrieve live wallet data.  
It does not require you to run a full node and never accesses private keys.

Aperio fetches data from the **blockchain.com public API** in real time:

const apiUrl = `https://blockchain.info/balance?active=${address}`;
console.log(`[Cache Miss/Stale] Making API request for ${address} from URL: ${apiUrl}`);

## 💡 Use Cases

- Check balances before sending or receiving Bitcoin  
- Verify payments on the fly  
- Quickly analyze wallets with just a highlight  
- Replace the need for clunky blockchain explorers
